Run ./splitDataset to split the dataset contained in dataset.dat using ID3.

The dataset in dataset.dat must be a /numeric/ matrix where every row represents
an instance. For each row, the first column represents the class of the instance,
while the other rows represent its attributes.

The classes and attributes must all be positive integers, preferably small.
The included dataset.dat file gives an example.
