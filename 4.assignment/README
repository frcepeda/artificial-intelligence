The input format is

V E A
id1
id2
...
idE
idx idy
idz idw
...

where V is the number of vertices, E the number of edges, and A
the allowed vertices per color. On the next V lines, input a string
to identify the nodes uniquely. Then, on the following E lines,
two space separated ids represent a directed edge from the vertex
on the left to the vertex on the right.
