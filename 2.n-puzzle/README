To run, install Stack (haskellstack.org) and then run `stack build`
in the solver directory.

To generate the pattern databases, run `stack exec preprocessing`.
This will create one of the two pattern databases. (It'll take
a /long/ time, around 10 hours.) To create the second database,
edit app/Preprocessing.hs and run `stack build` and
`stack exec preprocessing` again.

When both are ready, cd into the solver directory and run ./runsolver.

Make sure to make the UI javascript point to localhost:9592 instead
of ssh.freddy.mx.
